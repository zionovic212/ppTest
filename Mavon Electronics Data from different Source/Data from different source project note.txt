A colleague from IT exported the store location in PDF.


Features Used:
Power Query 
Power Pivot 
DAX
Data Model 


---


STEP 1:
Use Power query to Extract, Transform and Load Data from multiple Sources. Create data connections and buid automated workflow that can be applied easily.
- Load Sales data from databases
  SQL Server_name = ZION_HP_PROBOOK\SQLEXPRESS
  Database Name = Sales Record
  Transform Data - into Query Editor(To explore the data)
  - Home, close & load to --> Only creat connection, Add this data model
- Load Product from flatfile(CSV)
- Load Store from pdf
  - Only select the important column, remove the rest
  - Promote Row1 to become the header row  

- Create Calendar from Sales Data
  - Right click and duplicate sales table
  - Keep Order date, remove other column
  - Remove all Duplicate from the table
  - Rename and change table name 
  - Add name of day, start of week, start of month, and year


STEP 2: Data Model (Store compress data and create relational models to join tables)... Sales(Fact table), others(Dimension table)
  - We create 1 -to- Many relationship in our data model

STEP 3:
Power Pivot -- Create Pivot table from data model

STEP 4:
DAX

Total Revenue
=SUMX(Sales, [Quantity]*RELATED(Products[Price])), I will Get the same result even if I write it like this =SUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity]*RELATED(Products[Price]))
---The most important thing is that the column should be indicated as the first parameter, followed by a comma.
 
Total Orders
=DISTINCTCOUNT([Order_Number])

When calculating something like total orders. You want to be careful and make sure you use DISTINCTCOUNT(orders column)

-- You will get error while creating total revenue.
- Edit sales table
  - Create a new column FROM EXAMPLE
  - Use the example from sales usd column
  - Convert new column to currency

-- Retry to Total Revenue measure and error should disappear.

VISUALIZATION
- Revenue by Month
- Orders by category

//Create Date Dimension

= (StartDate as date, EndDate as date)=>

let
    //Capture the date range from the parameters
    StartDate = #date(Date.Year(StartDate), Date.Month(StartDate), 
    Date.Day(StartDate)),
    EndDate = #date(Date.Year(EndDate), Date.Month(EndDate), 
    Date.Day(EndDate)),

    //Get the number of dates that will be required for the table
    GetDateCount = Duration.Days(EndDate - StartDate),

    //Take the count of dates and turn it into a list of dates
    GetDateList = List.Dates(StartDate, GetDateCount, 
    #duration(1,0,0,0)),

    //Convert the list into a table
    DateListToTable = Table.FromList(GetDateList, 
    Splitter.SplitByNothing(), {"Date"}, null, ExtraValues.Error),

    //Create various date attributes from the date column
    //Add Year Column
    YearNumber = Table.AddColumn(DateListToTable, "Year", 
    each Date.Year([Date])),

    //Add Quarter Column
    QuarterNumber = Table.AddColumn(YearNumber , "Quarter", 
    each "Q" & Number.ToText(Date.QuarterOfYear([Date]))),

    //Add Week Number Column
    WeekNumber= Table.AddColumn(QuarterNumber , "Week Number", 
    each Date.WeekOfYear([Date])),

    //Add Month Number Column
    MonthNumber = Table.AddColumn(WeekNumber, "Month Number", 
    each Date.Month([Date])),

    //Add Month Name Column
    MonthName = Table.AddColumn(MonthNumber , "Month", 
    each Date.ToText([Date],"MMMM")),

    //Add Day of Week Column
    DayOfWeek = Table.AddColumn(MonthName , "Day of Week", 
    each Date.ToText([Date],"dddd"))

in
    DayOfWeek
