## What is the purpose of a dashboard:
With a dashboard you can show relevant information to stakeholder at a glance.
It is a combination of more than visuals or chart.

An interactive dashboard automatically gets updated as new data is added.

Therefore I decided to set up a dashboard to provide answers to those questions
