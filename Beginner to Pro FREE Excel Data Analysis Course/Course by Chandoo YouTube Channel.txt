I learnt the following in the course:

1) How to approach a data analysis project
2) A real-world example of data with 10 problems
3) Step by step walkthrough
4) How to calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, quartiles, range, distinct items & count)
5) Exploratory data analysis in Excel
6) Analysis with formulas vs. pivots (necessary techniques)
7) Top/bottom performing items
8) Anomaly detection
9) Best in class analysis
10) Complete report preparation
11) Combining data in different tables (spreadsheets)
12) Answering open-ended questions
13) Preparing and using Excel charts
14) Challenges & homework assignment


I also learn below Excel features:
1) Using Tables
2) Formulas
3) Pivot Tables & Power Pivot measures
4) Conditional formatting
5) Charts
6) Data Validation
7) Keyboard Shortcuts & tricks


Median = 3437	This is the midpoint of your data when arranged in ascending (or descending) order
Average = 4136	This is the sum(total) of all the values divided by the count of the values.

From the above numbers, the average is higher than the median which means there are more higher amount in the data than lower amount.

Quartiles refer to the 1/4th or 3/4th points in your data when arranged in sort order.

Q1 = 1652

First, 1/4th of the values are less than or equal to 1652.
This means that 25% of the data values (or one-quarter) are less than or equal to 1652.

Q3 = 6245
This means that 75% of the data values are less than or equal to 16.
Same as: The top 1/4 of the values are above 6245
